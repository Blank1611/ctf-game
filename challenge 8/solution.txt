This was actually a problem I faced & solved at CSGames 2016, though mine has been slightly modified.

Essentially the solution works by doing the reverse of what the algorithm does:

1. Add the current character to the total result. (the subtractor? of the original algorithm)
2. Divide by 1337 (the multiplier for the original algorithm)
   Special Note: before dividing we must mod the "result" number by 1337. We know that if the number is 0, then it divides evenly into the "result" thus being the optimal case. 
                 Since 1337 is greater than any of the ASCII values for the characterset given this means there will only be 1 solution (1 character) that will work for that case
3. Rinse & repeat with the new number until we reach the base case which is 42
4. Finally the password must be reversed since we applied the algorithm in reverse.
